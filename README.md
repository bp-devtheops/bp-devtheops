- 👋 Hi, I’m @bp-devtheops
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining more experience in the devops space and participate where possible in the community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and exploring other languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now - just getting started!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I began my IT journey in the Sec Ops/IT Ops, space at 10 years old, on my windows 98 desktop, with my 4GB HDD - Good times! By 13, I wanted to learn C++ to develop games.(It was a bit complex for the age/skill level I had at the time!) - I have been passionate and growing in the field since - I started my career in IT and 10 years later, I learn new things every day
